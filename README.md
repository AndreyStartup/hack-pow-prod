In this hackathon, participants will use machine learning algorithms and weather data to predict the efficiency of solar clear sky in a state. The goal is to accurately forecast solar energy production based on various weather data such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed. Participants can use different machine learning techniques like regression, time-series analysis, and deep learning to build their models. To participate in this challenge, participants can explore solar energy prediction datasets and codes on platforms like GitHub and Kaggle. They can also research India's solar energy landscape to gain insights into the country's renewable energy goals, leading solar energy producers, and solar power plants. Accurate forecasting of solar energy production is essential for efficient energy management and sustainability. By joining this challenge, participants have the opportunity to showcase their skills and contribute to a greener future.
